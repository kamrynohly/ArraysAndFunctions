# This coding language is Python!
# How can we represent our to-dos on a computer?

todos = ["brush teeth", "make bed", "grab a coffee"]

# We can check our list by printing it!
print(todos)

# What if we want to check a specific todo we must complete?
# What do we do first?
print(todos[1]) 

# What will this print? "make bed"
# Arrays start counting with 0!

# To get "brush teeth" we use this index of 0.
print(todos[0]) # brush teeth




# What if we need to also need to feed our cats in the morning?
todos.append("Feed the cats")

# Let's check!
print(todos)
